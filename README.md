# XLNet For Text Classification
The repositry talks abouts using the most robust transfering Learning model 
in the field of NLP for text classification 

# XLNet 
XLNet is a new unsupervised language representation learning method based on a novel generalized permutation language modeling objective. XLNet employs Transformer-XL as the backbone model 

XLNet has outperformed BERT( The previous best in industry ) in 20 NLP tasks. It is one of the hottest innovations in the field of NLP

#  Dataset 
 The Dataset used over hear is the Standford Sentiment Treebank dataset 
 It has 4 labels
 [link](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/index.html)
 The dataset was accessed using the Pytorch NLP Library 

# Libraries Used
1. ` numpy`
2. `pandas`
3. `pytorch`
4. `pytorch NLP`
5. `Pytorch Transformers` 

# Fine Tuning 
It is the process of customising a pretrained model by chaning the top layers or adding a few
new layers so that it can be used to solve one's problem
